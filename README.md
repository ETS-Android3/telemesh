## Test Coverage
* This repo is configured with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [coverall](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/coveralls/). Every merge with *master* produced a test coverage report. Latest coverage report is available [here](https://coveralls.io/github/w3-engineers/telemesh?branch=master). [This](#Telemesh) badge here shows coverage status.

* To generate report locally you should go to project's root directory, then execute below command:
