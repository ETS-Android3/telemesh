Project’s Goal
----------

We intend to make use of mesh network. It allows for multi-hop,
peer-to-peer connectivity directly between smartphones, instead of
relying on internet and cell networks. Blockchain is used in the network
to uniquely identify each node (smartphone) providing a trust layer to
users without centralized signup. It also provides the infrastructure
for users to connect multiple separate meshes by sharing an internet
connection in exchange for ERC20 tokens. This offers an entirely new and
unique method of information distribution not possible with existing
technology.

For UNICEF, we plan to develop an open source messaging app to be tested
in refugee camps, specifically, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. A broadcast
channel would allow UNICEF to push vital information to smartphone users
about services like vaccination clinics, maternity clinics and schools.
The app would also allow refugees to message one another even if they do
not have a SIM card or cellular data.
