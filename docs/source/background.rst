Background
----------

Globally, 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced at the time of
writing this readme, and over 25.4 million are refugees. In Bangladesh,
there are over 650,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled violence, mass
killings and sexual abuse from neighboring Myanmar.2 Of those, nearly
60% are children, many of whom are orphaned Distributing information
about humanitarian services to large numbers of refugees poses
significant challenges for NGOs like UNICEF. While 40% of rural refugee
households have smartphones, many are unconnected due to a lack of or
poor telecommunications infrastructure or unaffordable cellular costs.
The UNHCR believes that connecting refugees would ultimately transform
humanitarian operations.
