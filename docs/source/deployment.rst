Telemesh Deployment
-------------------

After cloning the Telemesh github repo in your local machine it is effortless to build the Telemesh app.

Actually, The *Telemesh* app is using different ``URLs`` for different services. Preparing all those services is time-consuming as well as tedious too for outsiders.

Here if you want to simply deploy / build the *Telemesh* app, you don't need to worry at all about those tasks.

All the ``URLs`` and other permission related information are provided in a ``.so`` file as solid package to give you a staging environment the same as production for deployment purposes.

Just download the project and run.

But, we don't give the guarantee of continuous services for the staging environment, as it's only for deployment purposes.

If you need any help on any stage of your deployment and you want to communicate with us please join our `Discord`_ channel or communicate to our community manager
through [media@telemesh.net] & [info@telemesh.net].
